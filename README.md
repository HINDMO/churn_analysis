# churn_analysis

In this project, we aim to analyze the churn factors of the 'XYZ' company. The main question is: 
> "Is price the reason behind XYZ's client churn?"

To answer this question, we will build a model using XYZ's data to predict churn. Then, by analyzing feature importance in the model, we will determine whether price is a key factor.

Therefore, this project is organized into three steps:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Feature Engineering

* Model Building and Evaluation
